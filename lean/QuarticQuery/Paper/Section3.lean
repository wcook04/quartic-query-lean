# Proposition 3.2 in the paper's list-valued form

`Upper.tournament_runs` consumes the tournament's list with a verifier in continuation
form. Here the same stages are composed with a continuation that outputs the list
itself, so the program's classical result is a list of at most `T` candidates, and the
guarantee is list membership with probability at least `1 - 2m/2^T - Tε`, as in the
paper.

/-- Ledger: prop-3.2. Proposition 3.2 in the paper's list-valued form. Fix `m ≥ 2`
candidates, `T = ⌈log₂(1000 m)⌉` and `ε = 1/(1000 T)`. Comparisons are coherent
samplers of `cc` reads each (all workspace retained), with probabilities `a x i j`
satisfying (10) at every oracle input `x`. There is a program making at most
`T · stageCost` bit queries on every branch of every input whose classical result is a
list of at most `T` candidates, such that, pointwise in `x`, every `i_*` with
`a x i_* j ≥ 1 - ε` for all `j ≠ i_*` is in the list with probability at least
`1 - 2m/2^T - Tε`.

This is the paper's statement with its query bound left as the explicit expression
`T · stageCost m T cc ε = T · trialCount ε · 2 (2 ⌈10 √(2m)⌉ + 1) · T cc`, which is
`O(cc √m T log T · T)`; the asymptotic simplification is not formalised here. Unit
values of `a` follow from the samplers and are not assumed. -/
