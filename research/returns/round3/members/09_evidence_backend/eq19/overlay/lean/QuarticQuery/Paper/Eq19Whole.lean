# The complete equation (19), with both clauses in one theorem

Proposed round-three wrapper. Not elaborated in this return environment.
The imported component declarations have supplied source-current build evidence;
that evidence does not certify this new wrapper.

The law draws every address string independently with mass `μ`, all zero
positions independently uniformly, and a further uniform column independently.
The depth cap counts every bit query, including repetitions. `ℓ = 2*t` gives
the preprint's `m = 4^t`; no promise-support or hardness premise is needed here.
