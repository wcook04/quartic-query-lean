# Section 3.1 and the coherent-access interface

Status: unelaborated. No Lean compiler is available in the review environment.
This file uses declarations in the supplied source snapshot. It is not build
evidence, and it does not change the status of its imported declarations.

The geometry is the two-dimensional calculation of Brassard, Hoyer, Mosca and
Tapp, Section 2, Lemma 1 and equation (8), arXiv:quant-ph/0005055v1, pp. 5-7.
The exact trigonometric average is also Boyer, Brassard, Hoyer and Tapp,
Section 4, Lemma 2, arXiv:quant-ph/9605034v1, p. 3.

The full-state theorem `Amplification.bounded_amplification` is abstract.
The query implementation `Upper.Samples.amplify` measures a label and resets a
known basis state. Its exact label law is sufficient for the tournament. No
statement here identifies those two output interfaces.
