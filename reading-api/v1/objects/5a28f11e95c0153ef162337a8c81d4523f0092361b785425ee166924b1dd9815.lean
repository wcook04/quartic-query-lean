# Appendix A: assembly of the universal quartic bound

STATUS: UNELABORATED. No Lean compiler was available in the review environment.

This second route uses the general nonnegative matrix adversary theorem for
both parts of Lemma A.3, the spectral form of Huang's inequality for Lemma A.4,
and Midrijanis's exact decision-tree bound for Lemma A.5. It does not invoke
`Cslib.Quantum.complexity_le_mul_pow_four` or the project's existing quartic
endpoint. The A.4 theorem used here passes through an actual degree-dimensional
face, the literal recursive Huang matrix, and extension by zero back to the
original sensitivity graph. The full-cube directional alternative is retained
in `AppendixAHuang.lean` and is not the A.4 supplier of this assembly.

The explicit coefficient of this route is `35^4 = 1500625`. An optional hybrid
uses the library's stronger polynomial-method block-sensitivity estimate and
gives `19600`. Its block-sensitivity proof has a different route from A.3.
These are constants of the present implementation, not novelty claims.
