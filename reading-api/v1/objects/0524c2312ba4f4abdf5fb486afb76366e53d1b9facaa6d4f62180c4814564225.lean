# Finite-seed bridge to initially uncapped adaptive trees

NEW SOURCE CANDIDATE, not native-compiled in this reconstructed return.
Every ω selects an *initially uncapped* finite tree. This theorem pushes its
weights exactly to a finite set of behaviors and uses the joint-event result.
The measurable Ω extension is a further formalization obligation, not hidden
in the statement of this finite theorem.
