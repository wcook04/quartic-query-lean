# Explicit action-table compilation with finite query allowances

NEW SOURCE CANDIDATE, not native-compiled in this reconstructed return.
Measurability of every action coordinate and its exact pushforward mass is
proved in ordinary mathematics in `classical_completion.md`. This finite
compiler is a separate syntactic component, not a claim that Lean has already
verified an arbitrary-measure policy transfer.
